## A conan packager for FreeImage

Package the [FreeImage](http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html) utility using conan for Macos, Linux and Windows.

Parts of the conan file are derived from the excellent [package example by MichaÃ«l Roynard](https://gitlab.lrde.epita.fr/olena/conan-freeimage). This version diverges by simply taking the prebuilt version for Windows.

FreeImage retains it's original license but this repo is under the MIT license.
